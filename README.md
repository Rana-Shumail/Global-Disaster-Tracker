# Global-Disaster-Tracker**

Description:**
A Python Streamlit app that tracks global earthquakes, displays the top 5 strongest, and visualizes magnitudes with interactive charts.

Features

Fetches live earthquake data from USGS Earthquake API.

Displays earthquake details in a clean table using Pandas.

Shows Top 5 strongest earthquakes using a max heap (heapq).

Visualizes earthquake magnitude distribution with Matplotlib.

Fully interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

Shortens long location names and rotates x-axis labels for readability.
